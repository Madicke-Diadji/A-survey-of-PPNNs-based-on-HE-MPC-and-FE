# A-survey-of-PPNNs-based-on-HE-MPC-and-FE
This review focuses on Privacy-Preserving Neural Networks (PPNNs) based on cryptographic primitives such as Homomorphic Encryption (HE), Secure Multiparty Computation (MPC), and Functional Encryption (FE). Detailed methods and techniques are presented to enhance the cryptographic compatibility of PPNNs.
